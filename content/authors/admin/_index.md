Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jannic Cutura. 
I am a research analyst in the data center of the monetary policy analysis division at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html). I have held previous appointments at the [International Monetary Fund](www.imf.org) and the [Bank for International Settlements](www.bis.org) and I have a MSc & PhD in quantitative economics from [Goethe university](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en?locale=en).
I work at the intersection of data science and data engineering and my passion is to enable regulators & supervisors to use granular microdatasets to inform their decision making by provisioning high quality datasets and running analysis.
